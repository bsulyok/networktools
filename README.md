# My network modul containing handy tools.

All functions implemented for Adjacency matrix (numpy.ndarray) and Adjacency list (python list of sets).
I may include implementations for Adjacency matrix (pytorch.tensor) if I see it useful.

# External python packages used:
`numpy`
`plotly`

# Notes
Heavy use of expressions with list comprehension.
